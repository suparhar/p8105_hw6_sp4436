The adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing male victims to
female victims in Baltimore is 0.426 (95% CI: 0.324, 0.558), controlling
for victim age and race.

Because the confidence interval does not include 1, this association is
statistically significant. This OR indicates that homicides involving
male victims have approximately 57% lower odds of being solved than
homicides involving female victims, after accounting for age and race. A
range of reasonable estimates for the true odds ratio comparing the
probability of solving homicides involving male victims versus female
victims, consistent with our data and model assumptions, is between
0.324 and 0.558.

This plot shows substantial variation across cities in the adjusted odds
of solving homicides involving male victims compared to female victims
after controlling for victim age and race. Several cities (Albuquerque,
NM; Stockton, CA; and Fresno, CA) have the highest estimated odds
ratios, suggesting that male-victim homicides are more likely to be
solved than female-victim homicides. However, these estimates have very
wide confidence intervals that include the null value of 1, meaning
there is no statistically significant evidence of a difference in solve
probability in these cities.

At the lower end, cities such as New York, NY; Baton Rouge, LA; and
Omaha, NE show the lowest odds ratios, indicating that homicides
involving male victims are less likely to be solved than those involving
female victims. In these cities, the confidence intervals lie entirely
below 1, providing statistically significant evidence for lower solve
rates among male-victim cases. Although these cities appear to have the
smallest ORs, their intervals overlap, so we cannot definitively
conclude which city has the “lowest” odds ratio.

Overall, the plot illustrates that while many cities show lower solve
rates for male victims, the precision of the estimates varies widely,
and statistical significance is primarily seen among cities with larger
sample sizes and narrower confidence intervals.
